## Dockerizing a Node.js App: A Comprehensive Guide for Easy Deployment

Dockerizing a Node.js app is a useful technique that allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a container, making it easier to deploy and run consistently across different environments. 
In this blog post, we'll walk through the steps to dockerize a Node.js app. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites:
Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
Docker: You can download and install Docker from the official website (https://www.docker.com/).

## Step 1: Set up your Node.js app 
Assuming you already have a Node.js app, create a new directory for your project (if you haven't already) and navigate to it in your terminal.

## Step 2: Create a Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. Create a new file called Dockerfile in the root directory of your project and open it in a text editor.

Add the following content to your Dockerfile:


FROM node: 18-alpine

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000
CMD [ "node", "server.js" ]


### Let's go through what each line does:


    1. FROM node:18-alpine: Specifies the base image to use. In this case, we're using the official Node.js 14 image.
    2. WORKDIR /usr/src/app: Sets the working directory in the container.
    3. COPY package*.json ./: Copies the package.json and package-lock.json files to the working directory.
    4. RUN npm install: Installs the app dependencies.
    5. COPY . .: Copies the rest of the app source code to the working directory.
    6. EXPOSE 3000: Exposes the port your app is listening on (change the port number if necessary).
    7. CMD ["node", "app.js"]: Defines the command to start your Node.js application.

### Save the Dockerfile.

## Step 3: Build the Docker image 

In your terminal, navigate to the root directory of your project (where the Dockerfile is located).
Run the following command to build the Docker image:

docker build -t your-image-name .

Make sure to replace your-image-name with the desired name for your Docker image. The . at the end specifies the build context as the current directory.
Docker will now execute the instructions in the Dockerfile and build the image. This might take a while, especially if it's the first time you're running this command, as Docker needs to download the base image and install the dependencies.

## Step 4: Run the Docker container 
Once the Docker image is built, you can create a container and run your Node.js app using the following command:

docker run --name your-container-name -p 3000:3000 your-image-name


This command maps port 3000 from the your container to port 3000 on your machine, allowing you to access the app on http://localhost:3000. Replace your-image-name with the name you specified when building the image.

## Conclusion 

Dockerizing a Node.js app provides several benefits, including easy deployment, consistent environments, and improved scalability. By following the steps outlined in the above post, you've learned how to create a Dockerfile, build a Docker image, and run a Docker container for your Node.js app.
You should now see your Node.js app running inside the Docker container.
